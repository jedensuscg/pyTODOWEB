### pyTODO
This is a little suite of programs I created in my venture to learn Python. It started as a simple command line based ToDo app through the follow Udemy courseL https://www.udemy.com/course/the-python-mega-course/

It expanded into a rich feature application that I built onto over the course of a few months.

###Features
- Command Line and Graphical Interface options
- Add, Edit and Mark and Delete tasks.
- Support for multiple lists
- Remembers the last list opened
- Command Line version has full UNDO capabilites

###How To Use
**Method One - Entire Package**
This method includes both the CLI and GUI options, as well as a set of pre-created lists.
1. Download the pyTODO rar file.
2. Extract the contents of the rar file using winRAR, 7ZIP or other a tool
3. Inside the folder created, click on either gui_todo.exe or cli_todo.exe

**Method Two - Individual Executable**
This method allows to down a single file, either gui_todo.exe or cli_todo.exe. No precreated lists or configs are included. The first time the program is run, it will generate a default list called My List. You can then add any new lists.
